# Fibonacci Even Sum Calculator

This program calculates the sum of even-valued terms in a Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.

It does this by generating the Fibonacci sequence three numbers at a time and only sums the third one which is always even according to the property of Fibonacci sequence.
